# kermadec_quakes
Python code in jupyter notebook reads data from a text file as downloaded from the Wilber3 IRIS seismic archive and plots a simple map view and a depth vs longitude graph using matplotlib. Demonstrates how to read in a text file and use of various plotting features, e.g. legends, color bars etc. Note code needs up to date version of matplotlib as it makes use of the legend_elements to set legend variables. Part of an undergraduate level introduction to python coding course.
